Zpark is a bot that provides an interface between the [Cisco
Spark](https://www.ciscospark.com) messaging platform and the
[Zabbix](https://www.zabbix.com) monitoring system.

Zabbix can send messages to the bot which in turn are relayed to the specific
Spark user(s), room(s), or combination of both.

And Spark users can issue commands to the bot in order to retrieve information
and reports from Zabbix.
